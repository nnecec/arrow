To build components library and generate comprehensive documentation through a easy way.

## Why?

We inevitably encounter complex component requirements in business development.

The purpose of this library is to write a complete documentation to the component with a minimum of extra work.

So, we import:

- [docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz): generate documentation
- [Ant.Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design): provide basic components
- TypeScript: Better development experience
- Jest: test components
- Rollup: build and export clean library

## Get Started

### dev

`yarn start` and open your browser : `localhost:3005`

### build

`yarn build`

### test

`yarn test`
