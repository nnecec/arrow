To build components library and generate comprehensive documentation through a easy way.

## Why?

We inevitably encounter complex components requirements in business development.

Then we made more complex components to solve problems.But the more components, the more you need clear documentation.

We expect to import a mature base component library, like `Ant.Design`. Then based on the library to produce complex components, and with detailed instructions and demos.

The purpose of this library is to write a complete documentation to the component with a minimum of extra work.

So, we import:

- [docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz): generate documentation
- [Ant.Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design): provide basic components
- TypeScript: better development experience
- Jest: test components
- Rollup: build and export clean library

## Get Started
